# Trading Strategy Optimization Project

Welcome to our Trading Strategy Optimization Project! This project is dedicated to developing and optimizing trading strategies using technical analysis indicators across various timeframes. Our goal is to meticulously test and refine these strategies, ultimately comparing them against a passive approach using provided datasets.

## Project Objectives

Our project is structured around the following key objectives:

1. **Data Preparation**: We begin by preparing datasets for different timeframes, crucial for training and validation purposes.

2. **Indicator Selection**: Each team member carefully selects a technical indicator, contributing their expertise to our analysis.

3. **Strategy Development**: Using the selected indicators, we define buy/sell signals and explore all possible combinations to construct robust trading strategies.

4. **Backtesting and Optimization**: Through rigorous backtesting using training datasets, we optimize our strategies, employing various techniques to maximize profitability.

5. **Optimal Strategy Description**: We meticulously document the selected optimal strategy, providing detailed insights into the indicators used and the criteria for trade signals.

6. **Testing and Comparison**: Our optimized strategy is then put to the test using the provided test dataset, enabling us to compare its performance against a passive strategy.

7. **Result Presentation**: The culmination of our efforts is presented in a comprehensive Jupyter notebook, showcasing our findings through operations lists, candlestick charts, and other crucial visualizations.

## Trading Instructions

To access specific components of our project, follow these instructions:

1. **Results and Conclusions**: Simply run the code in "P2 Technical Analysis.ipynb". This notebook contains the theory behind our project, the indicators used, final parameters, buy/sell signals, and ultimate results and conclusions.

2. **Step-by-Step Project Justification**:
    2.1. Run the codes in the `technical_analysis` directory.
    2.2. Execute the optimization codes (`1d`, `1h`, `1m`, `5m`), keeping in mind that these may take some time.
    2.3. Run the codes in the `best_combinations` directory.
    2.4. Upon running the previous codes, proceed to run those in the `preliminary_results` directory.
    2.5. Finally, execute the code in the `final_results` directory, which contains the pure Jupyter notebook showcasing the project's main findings.

## Deliverables

Our project will deliver the following:

- **GitHub Repository**: A complete repository hosted on GitHub, providing transparency and accessibility to our work.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: A detailed notebook presenting our results and conclusions in a clear and concise manner.

## Conclusion

Through meticulous analysis, testing, and optimization, our project endeavors to uncover the most effective trading strategies. By leveraging technical analysis indicators and employing advanced optimization techniques, we aim to enhance trading performance and gain valuable insights into successful trading strategies.
