# Trading Projects

This projects aim to develop and evaluate algorithmic trading strategies using three different approaches: Technical Analysis (TA), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL). Each approach utilizes a combination of provided datasets and advanced modeling techniques to optimize trading strategies across various timeframes.

## Technical Analysis (TA)

Utilizing traditional technical analysis indicators, we analyze historical market data to generate buy/sell signals and backtest trading strategies. By selecting diverse technical indicators and optimizing their parameters, we aim to develop robust strategies for different market conditions.

## Machine Learning (ML)

Leveraging machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and XGBoost, we train predictive models on historical market data to generate buy/sell signals. Through extensive hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation, we strive to identify the most effective strategies for trading.

## Deep Learning (DL)

Exploring the power of deep learning models including Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) like LSTM, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), ConvLSTM, and Transformers, we aim to capture complex patterns in market data for enhanced trading strategies. By fine-tuning model architectures and training methodologies, we seek to achieve superior performance in trading.

## Project Structure

The project follows a Python project structure with separate directories for each approach:

- **Technical_analysis**: Implements traditional TA strategies and analysis.
- **Machine_learning**: Utilizes ML models for predictive trading strategies.
- **Deep_learning**: Explores DL models for advanced trading strategies.

## Objectives

- Utilize provided datasets for strategy optimization.
- Define appropriate variables and signals for each approach.
- Conduct extensive backtesting and optimization to maximize strategy profitability.
- Select the optimal strategy and compare against passive strategies.
- Present results and conclusions in a comprehensive Jupyter notebook.
