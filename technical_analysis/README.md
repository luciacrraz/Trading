# Technical Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project aims to leverage technical analysis (TA) to optimize and evaluate trading strategies using provided datasets. Below, we outline the project's structure and objectives.

## Project Structure

The project adheres to a Python project structure, consisting of the following components:

- **_init_.py**: Initialization script for the technical analysis module.
- **backtest.py**: Conducts backtesting of trading strategies.
- **main.py**: Orchestrates the execution of technical analysis workflows.
- **optimization.py**: Handles optimization of technical indicator parameters and backtest configurations.
- **signals.py**: Defines buy/sell signals based on technical indicators.

## Objectives

1. Utilize provided training and validation datasets for strategy optimization.
2. Select n technical indicators, ensuring diversity across team members.
3. Define buy/sell signals for each indicator and generate all possible combinations.
4. Conduct backtesting for each dataset timeframe (1d, 1h, 5m, 1m), tracking operations and portfolio value.
5. Optimize technical indicator parameters using advanced algorithms (TPE, Grid Search, PSO, Genetic Algorithms, etc.).
6. Thoroughly describe the selected optimal strategy, including indicator usage and trade signal generation.
7. Implement the optimal strategy with the test dataset and compare against a passive strategy.
8. Present results and conclusions in a Jupyter notebook, focusing on essential visualizations and insights.
